dotNETPrimitives

We often use native .Net classes like File, Directory and so on, that have many static methods. As the result we have specific classes all over the code insted of abstractions. 

This library contains covers for some .Net classes, that implement some interfaces. As the result we use abstrations ant not classes in our code.

When you need to make  changes in your code, just add new class, which implements needed interface
